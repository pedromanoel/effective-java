# Test Driven Study: Effective Java, 2nd edition

I created this repository in order to study the book Effective Java, 2nd edition, by Joshua Bloch using Test-drive Study.

I first learned of this study method with the [Ruby Koans tutorial](http://rubykoans.com/). I remember that I thought that writing code to study is a great way to learn, and also a little unorthodox. I think this is a good approach because I can flex my programming muscles while learning, which I think will result in a more lasting knowledge.

This is my first try at Test-driven Study (or TDS, lol!), and I'm really enjoying it! I hope you enjoy this as much as I do!

## How to run

Since this is a study repository, there is nothing to run here! The best way to navigate this repository is to read the testing codes.

Well, you can still run the tests with `gradle test` :)
